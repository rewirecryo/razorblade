# razorblade
razorblade removes known potentially unwanted programs (PUPs) from
Android devices, using [adb][https://developer.android.com/tools/adb].

It relies on an SQLite3 database that the user populates with known
PUPs. It then uses adb to identify any PUP on the list that's on a
connected Android device, and uninstall it from the device.

To use razorblade, your phone must have USB debugging or WiFi debugging
enabled.
